/*
BROKEN EXERCISE: ft_strpbrk / level 2
Describe the state before writing the loop. Use unsigned char for byte comparisons when appropriate. A string copy needs length + 1 bytes. Use unsigned values for masks and shifts. Test empty input and boundaries.
Describe input, output, state, and the stopping condition from the subject.
BEFORE CODING: write 3-5 steps in plain language and trace one input by hand.
There is an intentional defect; the original source may have other issues.
Explain the cause of a failure instead of patching only the visible example.
